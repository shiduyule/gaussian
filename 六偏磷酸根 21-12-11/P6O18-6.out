 IT WAS A GAME, A VERY INTERESTING GAME ONE COULD
 PLAY.  WHENEVER ONE SOLVED ONE OF THE LITTLE PROBLEMS,
 ONE COULD WRITE A PAPER ABOUT IT.  IT WAS VERY EASY IN
 THOSE DAYS FOR ANY SECOND-RATE PHYSICIST TO DO
 FIRST-RATE WORK.  THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUCH A GLORIOUS
 TIME SINCE.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT NOW FOR A FIRST-RATE
 PHYSICIST TO DO SECOND-RATE WORK.
